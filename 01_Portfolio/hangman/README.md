# Installing Hangman on your machine'

Save this game file with it's directories on your machine.

As per the pdf task instruction, it requirers the reviewer to activate the application by
typing in npm start. However, prior to this, please install the node.js package first as it's 
too large to transfer across dropbox.

Install node.js, navigate to the project root directory of the game file on your machine and open your terminal and type in `npm install`. 
This will check for the missing dependencies and install the node.js module.

Once node has been installed, make sure you are in the project directory of the game and type npm `start` to open a development browser to play the game.

### Hangman Instructions

The game will randomly pick a mystery word which you need to guess. You gave 10 guesses. If you get more than 10 guesses wrong, you hang your man and you've lost
If you need help, there is a red button that says help. Push it and you can be reminded of the instructions. 
If you need to restart the game at any point, push the green restart button to start again.
You will also have the opportunity to restart the game after each game attempt. Good luck!!

#### Resources and Solutions    

I followed Jesse from CodehackR's example to guide me on  the layout and logic for the project and then adapted it to my liking. He followed Brad Traversy's vanilla JS example on gitHub and compiled it for React.

I also relied on WebDevSimplified to assist with refreshing the useEffect and State logic in react. 

OpenAI for assistance with some of the conditional syntactical challenges especially with the the ternary operators in react as well as the logic inside the useEffect hook, which was very tricky.

Bootstrap and local css for styling.
