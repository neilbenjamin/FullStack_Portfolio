        <h2>The Telecaster</h2>
        <p>
          The Fender Telecaster was developed by Leo Fender in Fullerton,
          California, in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949,
          several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric
          guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market.
