Temperature Converter

A simple temperature converter built using **JavaScript** and **HTML**, designed to convert temperatures between 

Celsius (C), 
Fahrenheit (F), and 
Kelvin (K). 

Open the `index.html` file in a browser to use the converter.

- The script prompts the user for:
  1. The **temperature unit** they are converting from (`C`, `F`, `K`).
  2. The **temperature value** to convert.
  3. The **unit** they want to convert to (`C`, `F`, `K`).
- The conversion is calculated and displayed in an alert box.
- Supports input validation** to ensure only valid letters (`C`, `F`, `K`) and numbers are entered.

How to Run the Project
