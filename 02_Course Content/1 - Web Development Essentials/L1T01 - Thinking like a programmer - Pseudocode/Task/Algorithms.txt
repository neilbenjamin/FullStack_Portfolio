Task 2

Scenario 1
Create a function that prompts the user to enter their name. Assign the name (data entered) to a new variable called firstName.
Once that is complete, print "Hello " + the variable firstName to the console. 

Scenario 2
Once scenari 1 is complete, then prompt the user to enter their age. Assign their answer to a new variable called age.
Then determine the user's year of birth by subtracting their answer from the current year eg. 
user age = 38 && the current year is 2023, means 2023 - 38 = 1985.  Create a new variable called yearBorn 
and assign the result of user age - current year to the new variable, yearBorn.
Then print the following data to the console: "Based on your age of " + age (user initial input variable) + ", it looks like you were born in the year " + yearBorn (new variable we created to store the result of user age - current year to determine year born) + "." So in this instance the print would read "IBased on your age of 38, it looks like you were born in the year 1985."
