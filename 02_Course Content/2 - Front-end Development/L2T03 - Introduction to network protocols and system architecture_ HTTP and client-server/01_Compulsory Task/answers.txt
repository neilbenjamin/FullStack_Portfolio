1. Protocol, in general, refers to a set of rules or procedures that have been agreed to that run or operate systems, societies, governments 
and other elements, such as the internet. In computer terms, and in my own words, I understand the word protocol to refer to the guidelines, rules
and conventions that have been defined to allow data to be effectively transmitted across a myriad of devices between a web clients and web servers. In HTTP, 
it refers to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 
2. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is built ontop of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol system, (TCP/IP) which is the underlying foundation of 
networkign protocols that link and operate the internet and most computer networks. In short summary the TCP is responsible for breaking down the data to be 
transmitted into smaller packages and then reassembling them at a later stage in the correct order. The IP will determine where the data is sent using unique 
addresses to ensure that data is sent to the correct destination. 
3. A successful response from a server will have teh 200 Status code.
4. CRUD operation equivalents for HTTP methods are as follows: 
4.1. C-CREATE - HTTP Method (POST) - CReate a new resourse on a server.
4.2. R-READ - HTTP Method (GET) - Retrieve data from a server. 
4.3. U-UPDATE - HTTP Method (PUT or PATCH) - Update or replace an existing resource on the server. P-ATCH can also be used to update parts of teh resource that need to be updated instead of
     replacing the entire resource.
