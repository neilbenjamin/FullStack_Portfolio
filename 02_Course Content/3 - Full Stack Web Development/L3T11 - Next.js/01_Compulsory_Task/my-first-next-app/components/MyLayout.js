/* In our app, we'll use a common style across various pages. For this purpose, we can create a common Layout component and use it for each of our pages. Here's an example: 

Since Next.js is used to create server-rendered pages, adding a link using a normal <a> tag would cause a link that would be navigated to via the server. 
This is obviously not always necessary. 
To support client-side navigation (this takes place in the browser, without making a request to the server) we use Next.jsâ€™ Link API.*/

/*You can use this built-in component to append elements to the <head> element of the page. More info here: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#populating-head 
Notice that we add the link for the stylesheet for using React-Bootstrap components to the <Head>. */
