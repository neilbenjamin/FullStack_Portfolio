Here's how the data flow can work:

The App component fetches the list of cars from the server and stores it in its state.
The CreateCar component can create a new car and send a request to the server to add it to the database. 
After successfully adding the car, it can update the list of cars in the App component's state.
The CarList component receives the list of cars as a prop from the App component and displays it.
The EditCar component receives the details of a specific car as a prop and allows the user to edit 
and save the changes. After saving, it can update the list of cars in the App component's state.
The DeleteCar component can delete a specific car by sending a request to the server. After successful deletion, 
it can update the list of cars in the App component's state.
The FilterCars component, if implemented, can allow users to filter the list of cars based on their criteria.
By organizing your application this way, each component has a specific responsibility, making your code easier 
to manage and understand. The App component serves as the central hub for managing data and communication between components. 
You can also lift the state up to the App component and pass it down as props to child components to ensure consistency in your application's state.

state options

You have flexibility in deciding where to manage the state of your child components. While it's common to manage the state in the parent component, 
such as the App.js component, you can certainly create a separate component dedicated to state management, like your proposed StateComponent.js.

Here's a brief overview of both approaches:

Managing State in App.js: This is a common approach, especially in smaller applications. You can maintain the state for all 
your child components in the App.js component. You would define the state, pass it as props to child components, and handle state updates and logic in App.js.

Managing State in a Separate Component (StateComponent.js): In larger applications or when you want to organize your code more modularly, you can create a 
dedicated state management component like StateComponent.js. This component can handle the state and logic for CRUD operations, and it can then pass 
the relevant state and functions as props to the child components that need them.
